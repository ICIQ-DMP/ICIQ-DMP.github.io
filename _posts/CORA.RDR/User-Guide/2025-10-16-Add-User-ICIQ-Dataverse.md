## Add your user to ICIQ Dataverse
The [ICIQ Dataverse](https://dataverse.csuc.cat/dataverse/ICIQ) is managed by 
[ICIQ's Data Steward](mailto:amarine@iciq.es). 

You need to request your user to be added into the ICIQ's CORA.RDR instance by answering 
[this](https://iciq.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/digitalitzacio/FE9DhAXiz0NNu_F4AAh5nVcBVzAOW0XUpTe2IENWW0SI6Q?nav=ODgyM2NhYjUtOGRmMS00NmEyLThkYmQtYTUwOTg4YjYyZmM3) form.

You just need to introduce:
* Your username, that can be found in the "Account Information" section in CORA.RDR.
* Your membership to a research group, which will be used to add you to that subinstance of CORA.RDR.
* If you want to administer the instance: Check it if you want to have full control of the subinstance of your research
group. Mark it if you are the group leader or the responsible to administer the instance. 
* Notes: If you want to submit any other additional condition with your request. 

After the process is complete, you will receive an email confirming your membership to the subinstance of your research 
group.  

If you have any more problem, you can contact [digitalization@iciq.es](mailto:digitalization@iciq.es).

After receiving the email, you can now start uploading your datasets by following 
[the next article "Upload Datasets"](https://iciq-dmp.github.io/CORA.RDR/User-Guide/Create-User).
